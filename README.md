# Space-Time-line

Welcome to the repository for my Astronomy Timeline Project.  
This project explores the most important milestones in the history of astronomy, showing how discoveries and ideas have shaped humanity’s understanding of the universe. It combines history, science, and design to create an engaging and educational resource.

## About
The timeline highlights key moments in astronomy, such as:
- Ancient observations of the night sky and the birth of astronomy  
- Theories from Galileo and Newton that changed science forever  
- The discovery of galaxies and planets, expanding our view of the cosmos  
- Space exploration milestones, from satellites to human missions  
- Modern discoveries that continue to push the boundaries of knowledge  

This project is an interactive website where users can explore astronomy’s history in a clear and visual way.

## How to Use
This repository is a living document. You can:
- Explore: Navigate the interactive timeline and click on events  
- Learn: Read about discoveries and their impact on science  
- Reflect: See how ideas evolved and influenced modern astronomy  
- Share: Use this as an educational tool in classrooms or projects  

## Purpose
- I created this project to make the history of astronomy accessible and exciting for everyone.  
- My goal is to inspire curiosity about the universe and show how human knowledge has evolved over time.  

## Process
- The website was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with focus on interactivity and design.  
- I researched major astronomical events and discoveries, then organized them chronologically to create a clear learning path.
- I used online tutorials to make the codes and used AI to fix some bugs on the project

## Challenges
- Selecting which events to include while keeping the timeline concise.  
- Make the astronaut to move and look like he is in the space.
- Make the website interective with not too many options.
- Making sure the timeline works smoothly.  

## Learnings
- I learned how to present complex historical and scientific information in a simple, interactive way.  
- I improved my design and coding skills by working with front-end tools.
- I learned how to deal with some problems during projects and to keep moving on.
- I gained a deeper appreciation for how astronomy connects science, history, and human imagination.
